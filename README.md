## What is Modern Webapp?
Modern Webapp is an opinionated configuration boilerplate for a modern SPA development workflow.
Modern tooling is a nightmare to setup, so let Modern Webapp prepare it for you.

## Who is this for?
Are you a
* **complete beginner** when it comes to front end engineering? Maybe you're comfortable with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS, and you're ready to level up by building your first single-page application?
* **seasoned engineer** who wants to dive right into building a project with fancy tools like Webpack, CSS Modules, ES2015, etc. **without** the hassle of setting it all up yourself?

**Then Modern Webapp is for YOU!**
